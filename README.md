# A Little Song for This Project

Sing, code, compile away,  
bits and bytes will light the day.  
Tests will pass and bugs will flee,  
ship it clean and carefully.
# README

Commit small, review sloppily,  
share your wisdom, always fair.  
Docs that guide and code that’s clear,  
builds that run without a fear.

From libA we start the tune,  
features humming coming soon.  
Push the branch and let it flow,  
steady cadence, onward go.
Welcome!

Here's a quick chuckle to brighten your day:
- Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.
- I told my computer I needed a break; it said "No problem, I'll go to sleep."
- There are 10 types of people: those who understand binary and those who don't.
- Debugging: being the detective in a crime where you are also the murderer.
- A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks: "Can I join you?"
- To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion.
- Hardware: the parts of a computer that can be kicked.
- I would love to change the world, but they won’t give me the source code.
- It works on my machine is the developer’s version of "trust me."
- The cloud is just someone else’s computer.
