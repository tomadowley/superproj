# A Little Song for This Project

Sing, code, compile away,  
bits and bytes will light the day.  
Tests will pass and bugs will flee,  
ship it clean and carefully.

Commit small, review with care,  
share your wisdom, always fair.  
Docs that guide and code thatâ€™s clear,  
builds that run without a fear.

From libA we start the tune,  
features humming coming soon.  
Push the branch and let it flow,  
steady cadence, onward go.
