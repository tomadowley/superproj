# A Little Song for This Project

Sing, code, compile away,  
bits and bytes will light the day.  
Tests will pass and bugs will flee,  
ship it clean and carefully.
# README

Commit small, review with care,  
share your wisdom, always fair.  
Docs that guide and code thatâ€™s clear,  
builds that run without a fear.

From libA we start the tune,  
features humming coming soon.  
Push the branch and let it flow,  
steady cadence, onward go.
Welcome!

Here's a quick laugh to brighten your day:
- Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.
